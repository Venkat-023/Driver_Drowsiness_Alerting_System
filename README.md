# Driver_Drowsiness_Alerting_System
Real-Time Fatigue Monitoring with Dual CNN Models for Face &amp; Eye Status. This is a real-time safety system designed to monitor driver alertness using Tensorflow. Built from scratch using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system tracks eye and face status independently and triggers alerts when signs of drowsiness exceed a defined threshold.
